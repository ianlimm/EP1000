            <p>In here, i will be talking about how i used a 3D Printer.</p>
            <h3><u>Horse Chess Piece</u></h3>
            <a href="3dprinting.html#3dhorse">[Click here to see how i CAD it]</a><br>
            <p>
                I first exported my completed horse chess piece into another app called "cura". In the app, 
                i sliced my horse chess piece to prepare for it to be 3D Printed.
                <br>
                <br>
                The picture shows what the actual horse chess piece and the supports would be printed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="./images/slice.png"width="99%">
            </p>
            <p>
                The file for the sliced horse chess piece is then transfered into a S.D card and then inserted
                into the 3D printer, where it began printing.
                <br>
                <br>
                The 3D printer first discharged and excess amount of filament before starting to print the base.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="./images/3dprinter1.jpg"width="49%">
                <img src="./images/horsefinal.jpg"width="49%">
            </p>
            <p>
                The supports were then cut out to finalize the horse chess piece. However, i realised that it 
                was immposible to remove the supports in the base of the chess piece.
            </p>
            <h3><u>Final Product</u></h3>
            <p>
                <img src="./images/horsefinal1.jpg"width="49%">
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence, one improvement i could have made is to make the base not have so much overhang,
                making it redundant for any supports in the base.

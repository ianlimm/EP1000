      <h2><u>Step 1: Planning</u></h2>
      <p>
          Like every and all great projects, it always starts with planning, and hence that was what i did
          in the first week - Sketching and Drawing. I wanted to make a clock with a 7219 matrix display,
          that was able to keep the time even when the power was unplugged. Hence, i sketched out a basic 
          design.

      <h2><u>Step 2: 3D Modeling</u></h2>
      <p>
        The first version of the casing was simple as i only drew out the basic outlines and measurements 
        for it. The design was similar to my music box, hence i copied the method. I also included a hole 
        for my matrix display.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Version 1</U></h3>
      <p>
        <iframe src="https://ichat1891.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd968d18da869083f45ba?
        mode=embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" 
        mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </p>
      <p><a href="3dmodeling.html#musicbox">[Click here to see the Music Box]</a><br></p>
      <p>
        Now, with the general shape of the casing done, i had to design various mounts to hold up 5
        different components.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Support for Matrix</U></h3>
      <p>
        The first item was the 7219 Matrix Display.
      </p>
      <p>
        <iframe src="https://ichat1891.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd968d87bfb8f07873372?
        mode=embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" 
        mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </p>
      <p>
        I noticed that there were holes behind the matrix display, hence i designed it to ensure that M3 
        screws were able to fit in, mounting the matrix to the case later on.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Support for Arduino and RTC</U></h3>
      <p>The second item was the arduino nano and the DS3231 RTC Module.</p>
      <p>
        <iframe src="https://ichat1891.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd9686a5bbeeb7fee2906?
        mode=embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" 
        mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </p>
      <p>
        The RTC Module would be screwed onto the support using M3 screws, while the arduino nano would be 
        put onto a mini breadboard.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Support for Push Buttons</U></h3>
      <p>
        Finally, third item was the 2 push buttons. Additionally, i also had to design the top parts of the push
        buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <iframe src="https://ichat1891.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd96807b0c9d109bc6558?
        mode=embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" 
        mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </p>
      <p>
        The buttons would be glued onto the support, while the top part were glued onto the buttons itself.
        <br>
        Holes were also included to mount the support onto the casing.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Final Design</U></h3>
      <p>
        I then fitted every component into the casing, to check if everything fits before sending to 
        components to 3D Print.
      </p>
      <P>
        <iframe src="https://ichat1891.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd96897e44c46d8213439?
        mode=embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" 
        mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </P>
      <p>
        I also edited in holes onto the casing to mount the various supports.
      </p>

        To begin printing, i first exported all of my 3D Models from Fusion360 into Cura and used the above 
        settings to prepare it for 3D printing.

        To begin laser cutting, I had to first convert all of my pieces into dxf files and transfer them over
        to LibreCad, where i put all of the drawings into the same file. The drawing is then transfered to 
        the laser cutter, where it began cutting out my pieces.

      <h2><u>Step 4: Electronics</u></h2>
      <p>
        After completing the hardware side of my project, i moved onto the software. I first planned out the 
        connections by drawing them out on InkScape.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Wiring Diagram</u></h3>
      <p><img src="./images/arduino-1.png"width="99%"></p>
      <h2><u>Step 5: Coding and Testing</u></h2>
      <p>
        Next, I made a code for the clock, with reference to a video showcasing a digital clock online.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rt031sYztw" target="_blank">Click Here to see where i 
          got the code</a>]
      </p>
      <h3><u>How It Works:</u></h3>
      <p>
        The Clock is controlled using 2 push buttons, when both buttons are simultaneously pressed, the clock 
        goes into set mode, where the user has to set the hours and minutes. Additionally, the brightness of 
        the matrix can also be adjusted after the hours and minutes are set.
      </p>

        <img src="./images/test2.jfif"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/test3.jfif"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/test4.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <h3>Issues Faced: </h3>
      <p>
        Initially, during testing I wanted to also include the use of neopixels into my project, so as to 
        produce different colours. However upon connecting and testing, I realised that there was not enough
        power being supplied into the 7219 matrix display, hence causing the matrix display to hang. This was
        due to the fact that the matrix display draws in too much power for the arduino board to supply for 
        both the matrix display and the neopixels.
        <br>
        <br>
        The second issue I faced, was when I changed the push button switches to touch sensors, however upon
        doing so, I faced a similar issue where not enough power was being supplied.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lastly, The on/off switch which i wanted to add in was also no possible, as cutting the connection 
        between the vcc and the matrix display would actually make it unable to work.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hence, I have decided to forgo all 3 ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, after all that the tweaking the code does work, and the clock is able to function.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Final Result: </u></h3>
      <p><img src="./images/test5.jfif"width="50%"></p>
      <h2><u>Step 6: Wiring and Assembly</u></h2>
      <p>
        Before starting on the wiring process, i essembled the mountings onto the matrix to ensure that it 
        would fit onto the casing using screws. I also repeated the process on the buttons and rtc module.
      </p>
      <p>
        <p><img src="./images/mounting.jfif"width="50%"></p>
      </p>
      <h3><u>Soldering</u></h3>
      <p>
        Due to the size of my clock being very small as i had designed everything to fit perfectly, i had to 
        solder the wires myself, to ensure that i saved space.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hence, i started by soldering wires which were to cut to length to the nano, onto the 7219 matrix 
        display. Next, i put heat-shrink tubes onto the connections to protect it.
      </p>
      <p>
          <img src="./images/matrix solder.jfif"width="49%">
          <img src="./images/matrix hs.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        I then moved onto repeating the same steps to solder and heatshrink my rtc module.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/rtc solder.jfif"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/rtc hs.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        The buttons were the last part, but i had to first super glue the push buttons onto the 3d printed 
        holder. I then soldered wires onto the push buttons and protected the connection with heat shrink.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/buttons solder.jfif"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/buttons hs.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the last step was to solder on wires onto the power jack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/power jack.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <h3><u>Assembly</u></h3>
      <p>
        After soldering on all the wires, i assembled all the parts of the clock together to check the fit of
        everything with masking tape, which was ok.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/fit.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, i uploaded my code onto the nano, and tested all the connections of the components to make sure 
        everything works.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/codetest1.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        I then had to use a hand drill to drill a 6.5mm hole onto the back of the casing to mount in the power
        jack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/powerjack.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        After the last final test to check out the connections using a 5V power jack using a power source, 
        and not the mini-usb, I began the process of glueing the case. 
        <br>
        <br>
        However, I realised that the school was all out of chloroform - A glue designed to glue accrylics 
        together. Hence, i had to find another way. When asking around for other solutions of glueing my 
        case together, i came across a method of using hot glue to seal the endges of the case. By first 
        applying a small dap of hot glue on the edge and using a soldering iron to reheat the hot glue, 
        it created a very strong bond between the acrylics without much of a mess. And thus, i used that 
        method to glue all the other parts of the casing except the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/glue1.jfif"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/glue2.jfif"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, after a six week long process of designing and programming the clock, it was finally finished.
